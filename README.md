## **Understanding the Web Events Data**
The **`web_events`** table captures interactions that users have with a system. The key attributes in the table are:

- **`id`**: A unique identifier for each web event.
- **`account_id`**: The ID of the account associated with the event.
- **`occurred_at`**: The timestamp when the event took place.
- **`channel`**: The platform or method through which the user interacted (e.g., direct, social media, organic search).

From this data, we can analyze different aspects of user behavior, such as:
- Total and unique event counts
- Popularity of different channels
- Trends over time (daily, monthly, or yearly)
- Identifying the most active accounts
- Events distribution by time of day or day of the week
